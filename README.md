## üí£üí£ Issues Encountered

### 1. **Form** and **Cloudinary**

Integrating the image upload with Cloudinary presented challenges, particularly with passing props. Opted to use Shadcnui form to abstract away complexity.

### 2. **Popup Modal Form** and **Cloudinary**

Initially used Shadcnui dialog component for accessibility features, but encountered issues with Cloudinary integration due to overlay preventing clicks. Resolved by creating a new modal.

## üí≠ Things to improve

### 2. Modal Accessibility

### 3. Error Handling

### 4. File Structure

### 5. Code Clean-Up
